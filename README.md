# APICSS

"CSS meets API"

## This is ...

(x) CSS Framework<br>
(x) Preprocessor<br>
(o) CSS Methor


## Inspired by

* [OOCSS](http://oocss.org)
* [SMACSS](http://smacss.com)


## TLDR

"Use CSS as API that rarely modiﬁed."

"It gives dramatically less use of CSS."

"Give it a try! You can't go back where we were."


## You'll get what?

- Released from CSS hell.


## How?

### 5 Principals

1. Use 11 CSS files for OOCSS happen in real.
2. Adopt new naming convention.
3. Related classes must have same preﬁx like SMACSS for easy organizing.
4. Do implement design elements separately for you can pull those separately.
5. Avoid using background image as possible.

That's it.

## Naming convention

**Traditional approach**

- "Class name should contain a semantic phrase to prepare for changing the style in the future."

**New approach**

- "Class name should be based on their own properties prepare for using whatever purpose in the future."
