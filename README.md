CSS meets API

__This repository is DEPRECATED.
New reference is [HERE](https://github.com/BYODKM/3000/blob/master/src/assets/styles/main.styl).__

## This is ...

( - ) CSS Framework<br>
( - ) Preprocessor<br>
( v ) CSS Method


## Inspired by

* [OOCSS](http://oocss.org)
* [SMACSS](http://smacss.com)


## TL;DR

"Use CSS as API that rarely modiﬁed."

"It gives dramatically less use of CSS."

"Give it a try! You can't go back to the way it used to be."


## You'll get ...

- Released from CSS hell.
- D.R.Y. CSS
- Open/Closed Principle


## How it works?

### 5 Principals

1. Use 11 CSS files for OOCSS happen in real.
2. Adopt new naming convention.
3. Related classes must have same preﬁx like SMACSS for easy organizing.
4. Implement design elements separately for you can pull those separately.
5. Avoid using background image as possible.

That's it.


## New naming convention

### Traditional approach

> Class name should be a semantic phrase to prepare for changing the style in the future.

### New one

> Class name should be based on their own properties to prepare for using whatever purpose in the future.
