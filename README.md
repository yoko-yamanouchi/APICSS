"CSS meets API"

## This is ...

(x) CSS Framework<br>
(x) Preprocessor<br>
(o) CSS Methor


## Inspired by

* [OOCSS](http://oocss.org)
* [SMACSS](http://smacss.com)


## TLDR

"Use CSS as API that rarely modiﬁed."

"It gives dramatically less use of CSS."

"Give it a try! You can't go back where we were."


## You'll get what?

- Released from CSS hell.


## How?

1. Use 11 SASS files for OOCSS happen in real.
2. Adopt new naming convention like SMACSS.
3. That's it.
